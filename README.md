Flower shop website to practice HTML and CSS (flexbox + grid)


Creating a website for my girlfriends flower shop idea. In this project I will be practicing HTML and CSS by making a professional
and responsive website. More specifically I will be pracitice working with flexbox and grid for layouts as well as advance CSS styling. 


This was a project that helped me practice using flexbox and grid. Flexbox was used for one dimensional layouts and grid was used for a grid style layout of the flowers. 
I was also using media queries to create a responsive user experience when viewing on a iPhone 12 Pro. I tried not to overthink any sort of design or styling too much and focus 
more on increasing my understanding for flexbox/grid/media queries.
